# BlackJackV1

This is a little console based blackjack game I made a little while back. It was the first Java project I undertook. I think it could be improved in a lot of different ways, as it has many if statements and different variables that could be grouped into arrays. Im thinking of updating it soon as a testament to my improvements.

Anyways, the process for the game is quite simple. First, the hand object will take two card objects from a deck object. The cards will be marked as being out of the deck and put into the hand. Each card has a toString() method to make printing easier. Then, the score will be kept as the game progresses, with the option to take another card or stay at your current hand value. The program keeps tracks of wins and losses and when you are done playing, it is displayed.

One thing I regret is using a symbol for each type and giving them individual variables instead of grouping them in an array. Also, you must choose the value of the ace in this version instead of letting it change value depending on hand values. Hope you enjoy testing it!
